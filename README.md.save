# Cisco Configurator (gen-ciscoconf)

**NOTICE: This project is currently undergoing a rewrite. Expect it to have
bugs, missing features and crappy documentation. I will do my best to fix all
of these issues soon**

Cisco Configurator is a library and a toolset to aid with the configuration of
Cisco equipment, mainly switches and routers.

# Components

This software consists of two parts: the backend (pl32lib+ciscolib) and the
frontend (gen-ciscoconf+cc-tui)

## Backend

The backend is mostly made up by ciscolib, which depends on
[pl32lib](github.com/pocketlinux32/pl32lib)
